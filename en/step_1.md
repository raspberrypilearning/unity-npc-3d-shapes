Right-click in the Hierarchy window and select **Create Empty** 3D Object then give the new GameObject a sensible name.

Right-click your new 3D shape and add other 3D shapes from **Create** > **3D Object** as child game objects. The child objects will move with the first 3D shape GameObject.

Bring your shapes to life by dragging Materials from the Project window to the shape in the Scene view.

This NPC has a capsule body with child GameObjects that are spheres, a capsule, and rotated cubes. The shapes have been renamed to reflect the part of the NPC they represent and coloured with Materials.
